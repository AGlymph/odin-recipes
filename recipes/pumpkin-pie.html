    <h4>Crust</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold butter</li>
        <li>3tbsp cold water or more</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filling</h4>
        <li>2 cups mashed cooked pumpkin</li>
        <li>12oz can of evaporated milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt</li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven too 200c</li>
        <li>To make the pastry crust: Mix flour and salt together in a bowl. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Mix in 3 tablespoons water, one at a time, until dough is moist enough to hold together. Add up to 1 more tablespoon water if needed.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into a ball with lightly floured hands. Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Place a 9-inch pie pan upside-down on the dough; use a sharp knife to cut a circle of dough 1 Â½ inches larger than the pie pan. Remove and discard dough scraps and set pie pan aside.</li>
        <li>Gently roll circular piece of dough around the rolling pin; transfer it right-side up over the pie pan. Unroll, easing dough into the bottom of the pan. Use two hands to flute the dough around the top edges.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Beat pumpkin, evaporated milk, brown sugar, eggs, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt in a large bowl with an electric mixer until well combined. Pour into the prepared crust.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a knife inserted into the filling 1 inch from the edge comes out clean, 40 to 60 minutes. Cover the edges with foil if needed to prevent from burning as the filling cooks.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven and cool to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>.
